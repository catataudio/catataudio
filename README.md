- 👋 Hi, I’m @catataudio
- 👀 I’m interested in so many things, I guess now al that is left to do is to bring them all together. I went to a Music College, ended up being an educator myself, after years of developing my craft. I then had an oppportunity to work on the tecnology side of things, both with computers and also in arecording studio and post-production 3d video facility, I have also worked in the print media world.
The absolute need for digital content to HAVE to be analog, will always be the mission.How to digitize our knowledge, our world, and then make an analog, perceivable version of it, with the highest resolution possible. We have our work cut out for us.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some self-hosting projects, trying to make sure my systems are all talking to each other properly.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything.. it gets pretty complex here pretty quickly, and I tend to not reach out. I know people have things to do. but I'm always around.
- 📫 How to reach me: I'll have my site up again at some point. catatumbo.pro  
- 😄 Pronouns: ...he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: im not fun.
